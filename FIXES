4/1/99  knotscape_1.01 released.  The following bug-fixes and improvements
were made to knotscape_1.0.  Thanks to various people for notifying us of
these bugs!

(1)  The main "locate" engine, knotfind.c was overhauled.  It now has about
one-fourth of the original memory requirement: it now requires about 10MB for knots
of 16 crossings and over.  Also, "knotfind" had a tendency to produce a segmentation
violation for large knots, and (maybe!) this problem is now cured.

(2)  Bugs were fixed in "draw" and "knot_group_reps", which caused fatal problems
when Knotscape was being run by more than one user.

(3)  Scratch filenames are now personalized with the prefix K<process id>, to avoid
clashes when Knotscape is being run by more than one user.

(4)  On termination, Knotscape now deletes all scratch files belonging to the current
process.

(5)  Error handling has been improved:  if one of the binary modules malfunctions,
a message is displayed, allowing the user to continue with the other functions of
Knotscape.  Please advise by emailing morwen@math.utk.edu if such an error message
is displayed.  We might not be able to fix the problem immediately, as we aren't
professional programmers, but will endeavour to do so at the earliest opportunity.
