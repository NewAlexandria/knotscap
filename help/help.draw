The option "Draw knot" in the Action menu will produce a drawing of
any knot whose code has been selected with the mouse in the input
window.  If no knot code has been selected, the knot corresponding
to the first line of the input window will be drawn.

The drawing engine was contributed by Ken Stephenson, and is based
on W. Thurston's algorithm for generating a circle packing from
a triangulation of the unit disk.
