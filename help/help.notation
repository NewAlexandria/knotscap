The notation used for knots is the Dowker notation, which is adapted from a
notation proposed by Tait in the nineteenth century.  It is also equivalent
to an enhanced version of the "Gauss" notation.  The idea is to "walk
round" the knot curve, recording crossover data on the way.  Probably
the quickest route to understanding the notation is to study the 
&#Dowker Code Example%, which illustrates the code for a 4-crossing diagram
of the right-handed trefoil knot.

Suppose that we are given an n-crossing alternating diagram D of a knot K.
Choose arbitrarily a starting point and direction on K, and then
travel around the knot K labelling in order from 1 to 2n the points of K
which project to crossovers of the diagram D.  If we consider that two
labelled points on K form a pair if they project to the same crossover
of D, this pairing gives rise to a chart such as that given in the
&#Dowker Code Example%, where the top row consists of the odd numbers 
from 1 to 2n-1 in order, and the bottom row is the sequence of corresponding
even numbers.  Then the Dowker code for the diagram D together with the
choice of starting point and direction, is this sequence of even numbers. 

We may extend this code to non-alternating diagrams by taking the
convention that prefixing a number by a minus sign corresponds to
switching the corresponding crossover of the diagram D.

The code depends in general on the choice of starting point and direction,
but we can regard the standard code for the diagram as being the code
which is lexicographically least.  Similarly the standard code for a
knot type is the lexicographically smallest code, taken over all
possible diagrams representing the knot type.

When computing invariants, it is assumed that the crossover correponding
to the point labelled 1 is a positive crossover, according to the usual
convention.

"Dictionaries" are provided in the doc directory for converting between
Knotscape's numbering system for knots and Rolfsen's numbering system.
